Hello There!

Siobhan said that I should write something I would want to read myself.
Mostly I read books about science and maths.
I do not like proper novels.
In proper novels people say things like, ‘I am veined with iron, with silver and with streaks of common mud.
I cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench who do not depend on stimulus’ . 
What does this mean? I do not know. Nor does Father. Nor do Siobhan or Mr Jeavons. I have asked them.
